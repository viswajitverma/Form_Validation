# Form_Validation
Forms are an integral part of our Website. We need to verify all the details so we know the person filling the form is Human and not a Bot.
Create a Form with following fields and check if each fields have relevant data in it.

Required Fields:

Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password and Confirm Password

Validation Criteria:

1) Name must not be less than 5 characters
2) Email Id should have @ character in it
3) Phone Number should not be 123456789 and must be a 10-digit number.
4) Password cannot be ‘password’ or ‘name of the user’ or less than 8 characters.
5) Password and confirm password should match
6) Whenever any of the above are not met, the error should pop saying ex; “enter
correct email” or “password is not strong” etc
7) You can include more conditions and fields to the form validation but the above
are mandatory.
